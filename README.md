# Optimization-of-Cutting-Patterns
Welcome to my GitHub repository for solving the optimal cutting pattern problem! This project focuses on minimizing material waste and maximizing material usage for a given stock through advanced algorithmic techniques and linear programming. The solution leverages the CPLEX solver to find the most efficient cutting patterns.
